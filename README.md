Step 1: Setup and Connection
Hardware:
Connect the HX711 Module:
VCC: Connect to Arduino 5V.
GND: Connect to Arduino GND.
DT (Data): Connect to Arduino digital pin 2.
SCK (Clock): Connect to Arduino digital pin 3.
Load Cell (Weighing Sensor):
Connect the load cell to the HX711 module's E+, E-, A+, A- pins according to the sensor documentation.
Software:
Install the HX711 Arduino Library:
Open Arduino IDE, go to Tools -> Manage Libraries.
Search for HX711 by Bogdan Necula and install it.




Step 2: Calibrate the HX711
First, youâ€™ll need to run a calibration program to determine the calibration factor for your specific load cell. This will ensure that the readings from the sensor are accurate in terms of real-world units (e.g., grams or kilograms).
Calibration Steps:
Upload this calibration code to your Arduino.
Open the Serial Monitor in Arduino IDE (set the baud rate to 9600).
The program will prompt you to place a known weight (e.g., 500 grams) on the load cell.
Once placed, input the known weight (in grams) into the serial monitor and press Enter.
The program will calculate and print the calibration factor.
Write down the calibration factor, as you will need to input this in the next step.







Step 3: Run Read_1x_load_cell_interrupt_driven.ino
Now that you have the calibration factor, you can use it in the Read_1x_load_cell_interrupt_driven.ino example provided by the HX711 Arduino Library.

Steps:
Open the Read_1x_load_cell_interrupt_driven.ino example:

In Arduino IDE, go to File -> Examples -> HX711 Arduino Library -> Read_1x_load_cell_interrupt_driven.
Modify the example to include the calibration factor:

Find the line where the calibration factor is set, typically:

loadcell.set_scale(); // calibration factor set to 1 by default
Replace it with the calibration factor you obtained in Step 2. For example:

loadcell.set_scale(2280.0);  // Use your specific calibration factor here
Upload the modified sketch to your Arduino.

Open the Serial Monitor in Arduino IDE to see real-time readings from the load cell. This example reads the load cell in an interrupt-driven manner, meaning the Arduino can perform other tasks in between readings.






Step 4: Using the Program
With the calibration factor applied, the load cell will now return accurate readings in grams or kilograms. The Read_1x_load_cell_interrupt_driven.ino example will continuously display these readings in the Serial Monitor.

Summary:
Calibrate the HX711 with the first program to get an accurate calibration factor.
Use that calibration factor in the Read_1x_load_cell_interrupt_driven.ino example to ensure precise weight readings.
Enjoy real-time, interrupt-driven readings of your load cell on the Arduino using the HX711 library.
